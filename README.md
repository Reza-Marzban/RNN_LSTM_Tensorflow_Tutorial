# RNN_LSTM_Tensorflow_Tutorial
a basic introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks, and Long Short Term Memory in Tensorflow with sample codes.


for more information refer to the tutorial powerpoint and sample codes.

The sample code is a basic model that get 4 random numbers as input and the sum of those 4 numbers as an output. so it is a regression model.
